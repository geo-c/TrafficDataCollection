# Traffic Data Collection using WI-FI

This work proposed a Wi-Fi-based solution for collecting city traffic data, using a wireless communication technology as a traffic sensing technology. The traffic data was collected with the help of a transmitter and receiver. The Wi-Fi signal strength was measured in two test areas in Muenster, Germany. The first test area was Heisenbergstrasse, a single-lane road with little traffic. The second test area was an ending two-lane federal highway with a high traffic volume. Different techniques were used to analyze the data, and are documented in [1]. Further details on the application (including installation instructions) are available [here](https://github.com/Albertios).
